                        <p>
                            Hello, I am writing to express my sincerest interest in what I believe to be an exciting position at this company. I learned about your available position through an email a dean forwarded to my instructor. After careful reading I have decided a position at your company would be the perfect fit for me. I have pondered the cost of university tuition and even considered solely working for a year or 2 to raise the funds. This job would provide a flexible opportunity to raise funds for my future studies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am a chemical engineer major and will shortly transfer to the University of Arizona.  Although that is my major, I am heavily business oriented. I want to learn about all the main aspects of a business. From what I see, engineers occupy but a segment of a business, mainly the solution oriented and production process. It seems to me the Engineering discipline greatly deals with solving and optimizing solutions, but I also look forward to analyzing the marketing process at this company. It is my believe that a great product needs to be marketed affectively as well. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am also keenly aware about the significant roles computers and automation play in our economy. I am in process of learning various coding languages such ass HTML, CSS, JavaScript and MATLAB to name a few. Communicating with computers makes it possible for the completion of menial and monotonous jobs to be executed effectively and efficiently. No need for humans to repeat themselves if we can get a robot to do it for us.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am willing and able to learn what is necessary of me. You can be assured I will put in the work necessary of me as I plan to make problem solving an integral part of my life and career.  If you analyze my resume you will see the research internships, I have participated in. I found research enjoyable but realized that I wanted to be in more direct contact to the consumers service wise. To know that people appreciate the work I do is important to me. I want to know that what I dedicate myself to, adds value to their lives. I know a position at this company will be an exciting and rewarding experience for me in this respect.
                        </p>
